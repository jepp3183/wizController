# wizController

Very simple app/webserver that controls group(s) of wiz lightbulbs using the pywizlight and flask libraries. Built to give faster response times than ifttt when on the local network. 

Simply run `app.py`, and bulbs on the network will be discovered automatically. Then control the bulbs using HTTP requests.
